# WhitePrint AI

**Intelligent Architectural Design Assistant**  
*Powered by LangGraph & AI Agents*

</div>

An AI-powered floor plan generator that demonstrates automated residential layout generation from natural language descriptions. This system showcases the potential of multi-agent AI workflows in architectural design while highlighting current limitations of AI spatial reasoning.

## Demonstrated Capabilities

- **Multi-Agent Workflow** - LangGraph orchestration with specialized AI agents
- **Structured Data Processing** - Pydantic models for validated LLM outputs
- **Architectural Constraint Handling** - Ensuite bathroom logic and spatial relationships
- **Interactive Terminal UI** - Rich progress bars and professional presentation
- **Automated Validation Pipeline** - Multiple quality checkpoints throughout generation
- **Prompt Engineering Excellence** - Sophisticated template system for consistent results

### What Works Well:
✅ Complex workflow orchestration  
✅ Structured LLM output validation  
✅ Real-time progress tracking  
✅ Professional visualization generation  

## Technical Architecture

WhitePrint AI demonstrates a **sophisticated multi-agent workflow** using LangGraph for architectural design automation:

### Workflow Components:
- **Input Validation Agent**: Filters unreasonable requests
- **Room Allocation Agent**: Calculates space proportions and house dimensions
- **Layout Planning Agent**: Positions rooms using 3-row strategy
- **Door Planning Agent**: Creates connectivity between spaces
- **Validation & Rendering**: Quality checks and visualization generation

### Layout Strategy:
- **Bottom Row**: Living Room + Kitchen (main living areas)
- **Middle Row**: Wide hallway system for connectivity
- **Top Row**: Bedroom-bathroom ensuite pairs + guest facilities + storage

**Key Innovation**: Multi-agent validation pipeline with iterative refinement and architectural constraint handling.

```

The application will guide you through the process with examples and validation.

### Programmatic Usage

For integration into other applications:

```python
from main import graph

# Simple house request
result = graph.invoke({
    "input": "House 500m² with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living room and kitchen"
})

# Advanced request with specific requirements
result = graph.invoke({
    "input": "House 800m² with 2 bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, 1 guest bathroom, living room, kitchen, and storage room by the hallway"
})
```

### Example Inputs

The system accepts natural language descriptions like:
- `"House 600m² with 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms"`
- `"300m² apartment with 2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and balcony"`
- `"Large family home 1000m² with 5 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, and storage"`
- `"Cozy 400m² house with 2 bedrooms, each with ensuite bathroom"`

### User Experience Features

- **Interactive Prompts**: Guided input with helpful examples
- **Input Validation**: Ensures meaningful floor plan requests
- **Real-time Progress**: Rich progress bars showing generation steps
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs or system errors
- **Professional Output**: Clean terminal interface with organized results

## Workflow Architecture

WhitePrint AI uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate the floor plan generation process:

```
Input → Validation → Room Allocation → Layout Planning → Door Planning → Rendering → Output
```

### Key Components

1. **Input Validation** (`verify_request`)
   - Validates user requests for feasibility
   - Filters out impossible or unreasonable requirements

2. **Room Allocation** (`room_allocator`)
   - Determines house dimensions and total area
   - Allocates space proportions for each room type
   - Ensures essential rooms are included (kitchen, bathrooms, etc.)

3. **Layout Planning** (`room_planner`)
   - Positions rooms using the 3-row strategy
   - Maintains ensuite bedroom-bathroom adjacency
   - Optimizes space utilization to eliminate gaps

4. **Door Planning** (`door_planner`)
   - Creates door connections between rooms
   - Preserves ensuite privacy (bathrooms connect only to their bedrooms)
   - Ensures accessibility via hallway networks

5. **Validation & Rendering**
   - Removes duplicate connections
   - Generates beautiful matplotlib visualizations
   - Saves final floor plan as PNG

## Key Features Explained

### Ensuite Bathroom Strategy
- **Bedroom 1 ↔ Bathroom 1**: Direct private connection
- **Bedroom 2 ↔ Bathroom 2**: Direct private connection  
- **Guest Bathroom**: Accessible via hallway system only

### Flexible Hallway Networks
- Multiple hallways (Hallway 1, Hallway 2, etc.) for optimal connectivity
- Wider hallways for comfortable circulation (minimum 2-3 meters)
- L-shaped, T-shaped, or linear configurations based on layout needs

### Space Optimization
- Rooms expand to fill allocated areas and eliminate gaps
- Smart proportion allocation prevents micro-rooms (minimum 5m²)
- Efficient use of every square meter within house boundaries

## Technical Stack

- **LangGraph**: Workflow orchestration and state management
- **LangChain**: LLM integration and prompt templating
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and structured outputs
- **Matplotlib**: Floor plan visualization
- **Rich**: Beautiful terminal UI with progress bars

### Sample Floor Plan

<div align="center">

![Sample Floor Plan](samples/floor_plan_5.png)

*Sample 700m² layout with 2 bedrooms, ensuite bathrooms, guest bathroom, and storage*

</div>

**Generated Layout Breakdown:**
- Living Room: 182m² (26%)
- Kitchen: 84m² (12%)
- Bedroom 1: 105m² (15%) + Bathroom 1: 42m² (6%)
- Bedroom 2: 105m² (15%) + Bathroom 2: 42m² (6%)
- Guest Bathroom: 35m² (5%)
- Main Hallway: 84m² (12%)
- Storage: 21m² (3%)

## Project Status: Proof of Concept

**Current Limitations**: This is a proof-of-concept system demonstrating AI workflow orchestration in architectural design. The generated floor plans showcase both the potential and current limitations of AI spatial reasoning:

**Known Issues**:
- **Spatial Logic Errors**: AI may create impractical room connections (e.g., accessing storage through bathrooms)
- **Layout Quality Variance**: Results depend heavily on prompt engineering and LLM model capabilities
- **Architectural Soundness**: Generated layouts may violate practical building codes or livability standards
- **Room Proportions**: AI sometimes creates mathematically correct but functionally poor room shapes

**Technical Achievement**: 
- ✅ Successfully demonstrates multi-agent AI workflow using LangGraph
- ✅ Implements structured data validation with Pydantic
- ✅ Shows intelligent prompt engineering and iterative validation
- ✅ Creates functional visualization pipeline
- ✅ Handles complex architectural constraints (ensuite bathrooms, hallway networks)

**Future Improvements**:
- Advanced spatial reasoning models
- Integration with CAD systems
- Building code validation
- 3D visualization capabilities
- Professional architectural review integration

**Note**: This system demonstrates the current state of AI in architectural design - powerful workflow orchestration with spatial reasoning limitations. It serves as a foundation for future development rather than a production-ready tool.
